Credit Risk Prediction App:
This repository contains a Streamlit web application that uses a neural network to predict credit risk based on German credit data. The app provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and receive a prediction on whether their credit risk is "Good" or "Bad".

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the German Credit dataset, which contains 1000 instances with 20 attributes and a binary target variable indicating credit risk. The attributes include both continuous and categorical features, such as duration, credit amount, age, and checking account status.

Models
Three different neural network models are available for selection in the app:

Credit Scoring Model 1
Credit Scoring Model 2
Credit Scoring Model 3
These models have different architectures and activation functions, allowing users to explore the impact of these choices on the prediction results.

Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"

3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

5. Open the app in your web browser by navigating to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

Usage

1. Select a model from the sidebar.
2. Navigate to the "Prediction" page.
3. Input your data using the provided input fields.
4. Click the "Predict" button to generate a prediction.
5. The app will display the predicted credit risk as either "Good" or "Bad" based on the selected model and input data.
